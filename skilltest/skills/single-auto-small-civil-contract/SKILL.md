# Procedure SINGLE_AUTO_SMALL_CIVIL_CONTRACT: Car loan up to 50,000 PLN for a single applicant, applicant working on civil-law contracts (umowa zlecenie / o dzieło)

## When to use
Use this procedure when the applicant is single (no spouse), the product is a car loan, the requested amount is at most 50,000 PLN (50,000 itself is small) and the applicant is working on civil-law contracts (umowa zlecenie / o dzieło).

## Why the procedure looks like this
Small car loans for single applicants are a high-volume, low-touch product. The bank accepts the full variable income because the exposure is short and small, and it does not register the car as collateral: the cost of a registration pledge would exceed the expected loss. Speed matters more than depth here, so only the applicant's credit bureau (BIK) report is checked.

## Applicant's employment
Civil-law contracts (umowa zlecenie / umowa o dzieło) can be terminated at any time and give no paid leave or notice period, so only 70% of the applicant's income is recognised and the bank requires 12 months of contract history and a continuity check.

## How to fill the credit_analysis_engine arguments
- `procedure_code`: `SINGLE_AUTO_SMALL_CIVIL_CONTRACT`
- `requested_amount`, `term_months`: copy from the application.
- `monthly_income` = 70% x (applicant base income + 100% of applicant bonus income). All amounts are monthly net PLN.
- `living_costs` = 1 adult x 1200 PLN + number of dependent children x 550 PLN.
- `monthly_obligations` = applicant existing installments + 3% of applicant credit-card limits.
- `dti_limit`: `0.44`
- `stress_test_bps`: `0`
- `collateral_type`: `none`, `collateral_value`: `0`, `ltv_limit`: `null`
- `scoring_model`: `RETAIL_LITE_CC`
- `required_documents`: `ID_CARD`, `INCOME_STATEMENT`, `CIVIL_CONTRACTS_12M`
- `extra_checks`: `BIK_APPLICANT`, `INCOME_CONTINUITY`

## Common mistakes
- Do not add the vehicle as collateral even if its price is given; collateral_type is 'none' and collateral_value is 0.
- The base product has no stress test; use exactly the stress_test_bps value given below.
- The 70% haircut applies to the applicant's base income plus the counted bonus, not to the spouse.
- Keep INCOME_STATEMENT and add CIVIL_CONTRACTS_12M.
- Call `credit_analysis_engine` exactly once, with all arguments computed as above. Do not call it again to "double-check".

## After the call
Report the engine's decision to the user in a short summary: decision, DTI after stress, LTV (if any), and the documents the client still has to provide.
